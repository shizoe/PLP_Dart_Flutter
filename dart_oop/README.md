# Dart OOP Example

This project is a simple demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart. It includes a base `Animal` class and three subclasses: `Dog`, `Bird`, and `Cat`. Each class has its own unique methods and properties.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you need to have Dart installed on your machine. If you don't have Dart installed, you can download it from the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

Once you have Dart installed, you can run the project by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running the following command:

````bash
dart run dart_oop.dart

Once you have Dart installed, you can run the project by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running the following command:

```bash
dart run dart_oop.dart
````

This will run the `dart_oop.dart` file, which creates instances of the `Dog`, `Bird`, and `Cat` classes and calls some of their methods.

## Testing

The project includes a set of unit tests. To run the tests, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dart test
```

This will run all the tests in the project and print the results to the terminal.
