## Usage

Upon launching the app, users are greeted with the generator screen, where a random word pair is displayed along with the "Like" button. Tapping the "Next" button generates a new random word pair.

Users can mark a word pair as a favorite by tapping the "Like" button. The icon changes based on whether the word pair is already a favorite or not.

To view the list of favorite word pairs, users can navigate to the favorites screen by selecting the "Favorites" option from the navigation rail.
