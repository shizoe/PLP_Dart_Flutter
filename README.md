# Dart and Flutter Programming

This repository contains Dart and Flutter programming from basics to developing a full application.

## Dart

Dart is a programming language that is used to develop applications using the Flutter framework. It is an object-oriented language that supports features such as classes, interfaces, and mixins. Dart also includes a garbage collector to automatically free up memory used by objects that are no longer needed.

## Flutter

Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework built on top of the Dart programming language. It allows developers to build high-performance, visually attractive, and feature-rich mobile applications for Android, iOS, and web platforms.

Flutter provides a set of pre-built widgets that can be used to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces. These widgets can be customized and combined to create complex UI elements such as buttons, forms, and dialog boxes.
